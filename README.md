# IR analysing on Smart TVs

This project is aimed to study infrared communitations, focused on those between TV controls and TVs.  
Within the project, two Arduino libraries are used:  
######     1. *IRLremote* Arduino library developed by Nico Hood.  
>              Available: https://github.com/NicoHood/IRLremote  
######     2. *IRremote* Arduino library from Ken Shirriff y Rafi Khan.  
>              Available: https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote  

There are two scripts that read, decode and display IR signals:  
######     1. *rcv_IRLremote*: this script uses IRLremote Arduino library (above-mentioned).  
######     2. *rcv_IRremote*:  this script uses IRremote Arduino library (above-mentioined).
